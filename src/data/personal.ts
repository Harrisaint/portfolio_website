  about: `I'm a Biomedical Engineering (B.E.) and Data Science (B.S.) student at Stony Brook University. My work blends biomedical engineering workflows with machine learning and software engineering to create innovative solutions at the intersection of healthcare and technology.

I'm passionate about machine learning, molecular simulation, computational biology, full-stack ML platforms, AR accessibility, and engineering education. My experience spans from developing real-time AR accessibility platforms to conducting quantitative biology research using molecular dynamics simulations.

As a member of the Biomedical Engineering Society and Stony Brook Climbing Club, I value both technical excellence and collaborative community engagement. I'm driven by the challenge of translating complex biological problems into computational solutions that can make a real-world impact.`
